[DEPRECATED] declarativeetl
=========
Development moved to https://github.com/smath17/DeclarativeETL


Extended version of PygramETL, which uses a declarative specification (written in TOML) to generate an SQL script for the setup of a data warehouse, and generate the basic table objects used in PygramETL.
